XBMC DVD Manager, v1.0
=================================================

Installation:
	- Copy the "DvdManager\" directory to the "scripts\" directory
	inside of your XBMC installation.
	- Voila!

Note:
	- The script will not overwrite any existing files.
	- Be sure to do one of the following:
		- Save the files to a folder that is already in your video library, or
		- Add the destination folder to your video library
	
What does it do?
	- The script saves a dummy video file, impersonating the actual movie, using the title provided.
	- As far XBMC is concerned, the dummy file actually is the movie in question.
	- By "fooling" XBMC, you can then browse your DVD collection, view movie/cast/etc information in XBMC, just like any other movie.
	- When you attempt to play the video, it kindly reminds you to "Please insert the disc." :-)

The Story:
=================================================

Who:	Steven J. Burch, AsylumFunk.com

What:	XBMC DVD Manager

Where:	A media center near you!

When:	Envisioned on 2009/06/15
	Created on 2009/06/17
	Updated on 2009/06/19
	
Why:	To put it simply, this is an XBMC script that enables you to browse your DVD collection through XBMC, without having it on a directly accessible hard drive or network share. Of course, you can't actually watch the video without first inserting the disc, but XBMC will display an entry for it. This will allow you to see it in the list with the rest of your videos, view IMDB information and all of the other benefits that XBMC normally provides.  Attempting to play the video will display a short "Please insert the disc." video.

	The XBMC DVD Manager is a more than just software... it's a solution.
	
	Since most of my large video collection lives in DVD booklets on a shelf and NOT on a harddrive or network share, keeping track of it all can be a pain. I've got enough to wrap my head around in life, so the last thing I need is to worry about what movies I actually own and whether or not they're
	directly accessible by XBMC.

	I had recently started taking full advantage of XBMC by installing plugins and scripts that made my XBMC experience both easier and more enjoyable. I figured it would be fulfilling to create an XBMC script of my own, plus it would finally give me an excuse to learn Python.

	Later that night, I wanted to watch a movie, so I engaged in the time-wasting ritual that I do all to often; flipping through all of my pages of DVDs. But this time, the frustration with my problem met head-on with my new lust to create an XBMC script and the solution, this software, revealed itself.

	Immediately and before writing a single line of code or enumerating a feature list, I wrote down the following objective, which I hope will always guide the development of this project:

	"to easily peruse my collection of DVDs via XMBC... without ever leaving my couch"

	Love it? Hate it? Have an idea?

	I'm getting long-winded now, so what the hell are you still doing reading this?!
	Go ahead and try it out!!!
